- **Features:**
  - SUMIT integration (secure IDs only, no PAN/CVC)
  - Revenue tracking in minor currency units
  - Trial period management
  - Foreign key link to leads table

- Original view recreation

### 2. Validation & Testing

#### `migrations/test-migrations.js`

- **Comprehensive test suite** for both migrations
- **Tests:** Schema validation, data insertion, constraints, indexes, views
- **Safety:** Automated cleanup of test data
- **Performance:** Index verification

#### TypeScript Definitions

- **Location:** `src/lib/types/database.ts` (280 LOC)
- **Complete type system** for new schema
- **API interfaces** for lead tracking and SUMIT webhooks
- **Utility functions** and validation helpers
- **Dashboard analytics types**

## Technical Specifications

### Database Architecture

```
BEFORE: 10+ tables (pipeline, chat, support, users, leads, etc.)
AFTER:  2 tables (leads + subscribers) + system tables

STORAGE REDUCTION: ~85% fewer application tables
COMPLEXITY REDUCTION: Single funnel pipeline vs. multiple systems
```

### New Lead Funnel (4 Stages)

1. **`cta_clicked`** - CTA button clicked, session tracked
2. **`account_completed`** - Email/name provided, account step done
3. **`address_completed`** - Shipping address added
4. **`payment_viewed`** - Payment form viewed (not completed)

### Subscription Management

- **SUMIT Integration:** Secure token-based payment processing
- **Revenue Tracking:** Minor currency units (cents/agorot)
- **Trial Management:** Automated trial period tracking
- **Status Management:** 4-state subscription lifecycle

## Data Migration Strategy

### Existing Data Preservation

- **`leads` table:** Direct migration with stage mapping
- **`signup_users`:** Conversion to subscribers where payment exists
- **Pipeline cards:** Email extraction and funnel stage mapping
- **Attribution data:** UTM and source page preservation

### Data Loss Assessment

- **Chat history:** Will be archived (not business critical)
- **Support tickets:** Can be exported separately if needed
- **Pipeline metadata:** Lead emails preserved, stage progress mapped
- **User actions:** Non-critical logging data

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection

- âœ… **No sensitive payment data** stored (PAN/CVC/expiry)
- âœ… **SUMIT tokenization** for all payment references
- âœ… **Email validation** and CITEXT for case insensitivity
- âœ… **Session-based tracking** (no aggressive fingerprinting)

### GDPR Compliance

- âœ… **Minimal PII collection** (email + name only when provided)
- âœ… **Clear data retention** policies
- âœ… **Easy data deletion** via lead_id/subscriber_id

## Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategy

```sql
-- Leads table (7 indexes)
â”œâ”€â”€ Primary key (lead_id)
â”œâ”€â”€ Funnel analytics (source_page, stage, created_at)
â”œâ”€â”€ Email lookup (email WHERE NOT NULL)
â”œâ”€â”€ Session tracking (session_id WHERE NOT NULL)
â”œâ”€â”€ Time-based queries (created_at)
â””â”€â”€ Stage filtering (stage)

-- Subscribers table (6 indexes)
â”œâ”€â”€ Primary key (subscriber_id)
â”œâ”€â”€ Email lookup + unique constraint
â”œâ”€â”€ Status filtering (status)
â”œâ”€â”€ SUMIT integration (sumit_customer_id + unique)
â”œâ”€â”€ Trial management (trial_end WHERE NOT NULL)
â””â”€â”€ Analytics (created_at)
```

### Query Performance

- **Dashboard queries:** Pre-aggregated views
- **Funnel analysis:** Single table queries vs. complex joins
- **Revenue reporting:** Indexed status and date columns

## Next Steps - Gate C Preview

### API Endpoints (Planned)

- `POST /api/lead/track` - Lead funnel progression tracking
- `POST /api/webhooks/sumit` - SUMIT payment processing
- **Features:** Zod validation, error handling, rate limiting

### Frontend Integration

- **Dashboard simplification** to Overview only
- **4-stage funnel visualization**
- **Real-time metrics** from new analytics views

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] Database structure documented and mapped
- [x] Complete backup system created and tested
- [x] Data migration strategy defined
- [x] Rollback plan documented

### Gate B âœ…

- [x] SQL migrations created (leads + subscribers)
- [x] Data validation and constraints implemented
- [x] Analytics views created for dashboard
- [x] TypeScript definitions generated
- [x] Test suite created and validated

- [ ] SUMIT webhook integration
- [ ] Dashboard updates

## Approval Checklist

Before proceeding to Gate C implementation:

- [ ] **Stakeholder review** of database reduction plan
- [ ] **Backup verification** - ensure all current data is safely exported
- [ ] **Migration testing** - run test suite on staging environment
- [ ] **Performance impact** assessment
- [ ] **Security review** of new schema

---

**Status:** Ready for Gate C implementation pending stakeholder approval  
**Risk Level:** Low (comprehensive backups and rollback procedures in place)  
**Timeline:** Gates A & B completed on schedule, Gate C estimated 2-3 days
