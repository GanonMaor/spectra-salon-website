## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### New Tables Created

```sql
public.leads (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  email text NOT NULL,
  phone text,
  source text,                    -- page source
  cta_clicked text,               -- button clicked
  message text,                   -- contact form message
  status text DEFAULT 'new',      -- lead status
  summit_status text,             -- Summit API status
  user_id uuid,                   -- linked user
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)
```

#### 2. CTA Clicks Table

```sql
public.cta_clicks (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  button_name text NOT NULL,      -- button identifier

  device_type text,               -- mobile/desktop/tablet
  user_agent text,                -- browser info
  user_id uuid,                   -- if logged in
  session_id text,                -- anonymous tracking
  ip_address inet,                -- for analytics
  referrer text,                  -- traffic source
  timestamp timestamp
)
```

#### 3. Admin Logs Table

```sql
public.admin_logs (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  admin_id uuid NOT NULL,         -- admin who performed action
  action text NOT NULL,           -- create/update/delete/view
  target_type text NOT NULL,      -- user/lead/payment/etc
  target_id text,                 -- affected record ID
  details jsonb,                  -- additional info
  ip_address inet,
  user_agent text,
  timestamp timestamp
)
```

### RLS Policies Implemented

#### Users Table Policies

- `users_select_own` - Users can read their own profile
- `users_update_own` - Users can update their own profile (except role)
- `users_select_admin` - Admins can read all users
- `users_update_admin` - Admins can update all users
- `users_insert_authenticated` - Allow user registration

#### Leads Table Policies

- `leads_select_admin` - Only admins can read all leads
- `leads_select_own` - Users can read their own leads
- `leads_insert_admin` - Only admins can manually insert leads
- `leads_insert_anonymous` - Allow anonymous lead capture
- `leads_update_admin` - Only admins can update leads
- `leads_delete_admin` - Only admins can delete leads

#### CTA Clicks Table Policies

- `cta_clicks_select_admin` - Only admins can read all clicks
- `cta_clicks_select_own` - Users can read their own clicks
- `cta_clicks_insert_all` - Anyone can insert clicks (for tracking)
- `cta_clicks_update_admin` - Only admins can update clicks
- `cta_clicks_delete_admin` - Only admins can delete clicks

#### Admin Logs Table Policies

- `admin_logs_select_admin` - Only admins can read logs
- `admin_logs_insert_admin` - Only admins can create logs
- No update/delete policies (append-only for audit integrity)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. RLS Blocking Access

```sql
-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'your_table';
```

#### 2. Admin Dashboard Not Loading

- Check user role in database
- Verify admin policies are applied
- Check browser console for API errors

#### 3. CTA Tracking Not Working

- Verify anonymous insert permissions
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure session ID is generated

#### 4. Protected Routes Not Working

- Check UserContext is properly wrapped
- Verify user authentication state
- Check role assignment in database
