## Development Guidelines

### Action Logging

Every significant user action should be logged using the ActionLogger utility:

```typescript
import { useActionLogger } from "../utils/actionLogger";

const { logButtonClick, logNavigation, logDataView } = useActionLogger();

// Log button clicks
await logButtonClick("export_leads", "leads_page", { export_format: "csv" });

// Log navigation
await logNavigation("/admin/leads", "/admin/leads/import");

// Log data views
await logDataView("leads", { source_filter: "home_page" }, 25);
```

### Metric Cards

Use the MetricCard component for consistent dashboard metrics:

```typescript
<MetricCard
  title="Total Leads"
  value={leads.length}
  subtitle="This month"
  trend={{ value: 12, label: "vs last month", direction: "up" }}
  icon={UsersIcon}
  onClick={() => navigateToLeads()}
/>
```

### Error Handling

All new components must handle errors gracefully and provide fallback content.
